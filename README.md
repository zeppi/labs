### Zeppi-biorythme

Create a basic Facebook application. Normally I do an hello world, but is not very funny for facebook. I was looking for original idea and suddenly, I remembered an exercise in Excel programming was to calculate the Biorithme.

By the way, I would test Silex micro framework and RedBeanPhp micro orm. Micro tools for micro project :-)
